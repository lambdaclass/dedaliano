## Unreleased

### MITC4 shell element: Bathe-Dvorkin ANS shear tying

- implemented true assumed natural strain (ANS) transverse shear interpolation (Bathe & Dvorkin, 1986) in the MITC4 quad shell element
- uses covariant strain tying at 4 edge midpoints with Jacobian-correct transformation at each Gauss point, eliminating transverse shear locking on thin plates
- benchmark improvements: Scordelis-Lo 6×6 ratio from 0.14 to 0.80, Navier plate from 0.08 to 0.93, cantilever pressure from 0.10 to 1.05, buckling from wide tolerance to 1.02, modal frequencies from ~6× error to 0.1% error
- tightened shell benchmark tolerances across the board to lock in the formulation quality
- added `quad_check_jacobian()` for negative/degenerate Jacobian detection
- added moderate warping diagnostics (0.01-0.1 range) in assembly
- added dedicated thin-plate locking test (a/t = 1000) to prevent regression
- expanded CI shell benchmark gate to cover plate bending, Navier convergence, Scordelis-Lo, cantilever, hemisphere, and thin-plate tests
- latest reported full-suite status reached `6345` passing tests with `0` failures

### Solver quality milestone

- latest reported full-suite status reached `6344` passing tests with `0` failures
- fixed the staged fixed-end-force accumulation bug by tracking cumulative loads across stages
- corrected four pre-existing TME validation expectations involving formulas, sign conventions, and a wrong midspan-node assumption

### Constraints and connectors

- pushed constraint-system unification further across solver families
- added connector-element assembly coverage across dense and sparse 2D/3D paths
- added constraint-force output in constrained solver paths
- added eccentric-connection integration tests and new constraint benchmark coverage

### Benchmark gates

- added explicit gate suites for:
  - constraints
  - contact
  - shells
  - reduction
  - sparse and conditioning paths
- added explicit CI gate steps for shell benchmarks, shell acceptance models, and constraint benchmarks before the full suite

### Shell and nonlinear 3D workflows

- verified quad shell load vectors, mass, geometric stiffness, and quality metrics
- verified mixed DKT and MITC4 assembly and beam-shell DOF interfacing
- wired plate and quad stress recovery into the major nonlinear 3D solver families
- added beam-shell mixed benchmarks, shell buckling benchmarks, shell thermal benchmarks, and shell acceptance models
- added plate geometric stiffness contribution in 3D buckling
- added assembly diagnostics for distorted/low-quality plate and quad meshes
- added full nodal stress tensor recovery for MITC4 quads

### Constraint deepening

- propagated constraint-force output into plastic and fiber nonlinear solver paths
- added cross-solver constraint-force parity coverage

### Performance and scale

- added conditioning diagnostics
- added sparse triplet assembly infrastructure
- added parallel element assembly behind the `parallel` feature flag
- extended criterion benchmarks with larger-model assembly and dense-vs-sparse solve comparisons
- switched CI and local default full-suite execution toward `cargo nextest`, with engine-local nextest config and Linux `mold` linker support
